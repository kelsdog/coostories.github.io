            The community was started in 2015 by Kelsey Traher and Ben Gateley
            as a place for COOs to ask questions and get advice.
          </p>

            issue one of the group is currently facing.
          </p>

          <p>
            We run an annual longer-form event in October we call COO Bootcamp.

          </p>

          <h1>Running the group</h1>

          <p>
            It takes a bit of work to keep things moving and feeling fresh, esp
            alongside full time COO roles - who knew?! :)
          </p>

          <p>
            Jess Ruben, COO of Judo Pay joins us in 2020! A six-month stint for
            a COO friend to get more involved and help us move things forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            And you? This community is yours. If you have an idea for a survey
            you want to run, a project you want to bring to life, or an event
            you want to run, go for it. If it genuinely adds value to the London
            tech community, make it happen!
          </p>

          <h1>New members</h1>

          <p>We grow through recommendations from the existing community.</p>

          <p>

              COO, VP Ops or Director Ops
            </li>
            <li>And the most senior ops person in their business</li>
            <li>
              At a tech company (usually VC backed), or a company that is
              tech-enabled and innovative in its space
            </li>

          </ul>

          <p>
            *This means you know them as a friend or have worked with them
            before. Not just someone you met once or want to do a favour for,
            you really know them and are willing to bring them in to the
            community with your recommendation.
          </p>

            <li>How you know them</li>
            <li>Why you think they’d be a great new member of the community</li>
          </ul>

          </p>

          <h2>4: DECISION POINT</h2>
          <p>
            We make a judgement call on whether to bring them in to the
            community or not. If we ever decide it’s a no, we’ll let you know as
            well as your person, and why.
          </p>

          <h2>5: THEY ARE WELCOMED IN!</h2>
          <p>
            The new COO Stories member gets added to the mailing list and slack
            group.
          </p>

          <h1>COMMUNITY BASICS AND RULES</h1>

          <h3>A few basics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Participate - come to events, reply thoughtfully to email threads,
              generally aim to net contribute to the community
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask questions - the community is driven by it’s members, so please
              use and engage with the group.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be helpful - if you have an opinion, piece of advice or connection
              that could help another member, share it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make connections - there are so many super smart people in the
              community to meet and learn from.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>And a few rules</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>No investors or VCs</li>
            <li>Only one person from each company</li>
            <li>
              Obviously no salesy promotion of your own company (offering
              freebies or discounts is great though)
            </li>
            <li>We prefer you not to use the main email list to:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ask for candidates for a role you’re hiring for (offering
                candidates is fine though).
              </li>
              <li>
                Promote something like an event you’re running (unless you think
                your offer is truly value-add)
              </li>
              <li>
                For both of the above examples - use a specific channel in slack
                instead
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
